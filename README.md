Homework 3 for EM622-WS Decision Making via Data Analysis at Stevens Institute of Technology

Objective:  
Analyze breast cancer data to determine if there are correlations between tumor location, tumor count, and treatment.

Files:  
BreastCancerAnalysis.R - R code where analysis was complete.  
BreastCancerAnalysis_Report.pdf - PDF of analysis report.  
breast-cancer(2).data - data file of specific data used in this project.  

Data Source:

Background:  
This project was completed in Late 2022. While I was starting to slowly understand R, I was still very beginner and relied heavily on notes and documenation.
While the code may be amateurish, I still tried to provide meaningful visuals that were easy to understand. The final visual might be a little complex for some people to immediately understand, but I found that most people I showed it to were able to understand in a few minutes or with a small explanation.
